# Quantum Symbols Project

## Overview
The Quantum Symbols project is a minimal and visually striking single-page application (SPA) that features a set of floating symbols inspired by quantum themes. The application is designed to be mobile-optimized and works seamlessly across all modern browsers, including Chrome, Edge, Safari, Opera, Brave, and Arc.

## Features
- Floating symbols that respond to user interactions.
- Full-screen modal display for content when symbols are clicked.
- Visually appealing background graphics that convey a quantum theme with undulating colors and rounded geometric shapes.
- Built using TypeScript for robust and maintainable code.
