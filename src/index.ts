      '<p>The soundscape of the exhibition blends recordings from real quantum experiments with sonified data. Inspired by Pauline Oliveros\' concept of Quantum Listening, what at first seems like a steady drone gradually reveals subtle shifts and rich textures, mirroring the hidden complexity of the quantum world.</p>\n' +
      '<p>I used the digital tool PaulXStretch to stretch audio and expose the sound particles within. Oliveros (1930‚Äì2016), an influential sound artist and philosopher, developed the idea of the listening effect, which parallels the observer effect in quantum physics, where the act of observing a particle changes the behavior of the particle (remember Schr√∂dinger\'s cat?). As she wrote: "What is heard is changed by listening, and changes the listener."</p>\n' +
      '<p>I positioned different sound sources in various parts of the space, not only to create a more immersive sonic environment, but also to reflect her idea that "Quantum Listening is listening to more than one reality simultaneously." One of the sound sources plays poetry by Glasgow-based artist and activist Nadia Violette‚Äîa reflection on static vision and its curious visual parallel to the quantum world.</p>\n' +

      '<p>What does \'quantum\' mean to you?</p>\n' +
      '<p>This sound piece plays an infinite loop of voice notes from non-experts answering that question. Housed inside a literal black box, it reflects how the field of quantum physics is often seen: mysterious, sealed off and a little intimidating. And yet, somehow, we\'ve all heard the word.</p>\n' +
      '<p>The word quantum has become part of our everyday language‚Äîappearing in music, psychology, philosophy, art, spirituality, science fiction, film, wellness, and beyond. This cultural spread has been shaped less by physicists and more by artists, writers, filmmakers, and thinkers‚Äîthose who reinterpret science through metaphor, story, and imagination.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Of course, there\'s something a bit ironic here. While this exhibition continues the tradition of non-experts reinterpreting quantum through artistic imagination, it also reflects a gap in how the field has been communicated. In a world where science can feel distant, overly complex, or even elitist, there\'s room (and a need) for more generous, open dialogue between scientists and the public...especially when complex scientific language like quantum terminology is sometimes used or communicated in ways that can mislead or have unintended consequences.</p>\n' +
      '<p>Still, the concept has become wonderfully malleable. It\'s been stretched and abstracted; it now means everything‚Ä¶ and nothing. But across all these interpretations, one thing tends to remain: a sense of ungraspability. The word quantum gestures toward something that resists certainty‚Äîsomething fundamentally unknowable, just out of reach. Perhaps that\'s why it resonates so deeply: it mirrors our experience of reality in some way.</p>\n' +
      '<p>This piece invites listeners to reflect on their own interpretation of the term. Some voice notes are funny, some thoughtful, some poetic or uncertain. But together, they suggest something bigger: that reality is more complex than it seems. That not knowing is okay. That curiosity is enough.</p>\n' +
